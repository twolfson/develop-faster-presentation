// DEV: This intro is a little bit long, we only have 20-25 minutes

// As the title suggests, today we are going to be talking about developing faster.

// I am not going to be talking about developer hacks (e.g. 1 letter aliases)

// I am going to be focusing on tools.

// I like to think of a famous quote: "A man is only as good as his tools."

// TODO: Make comment about gender equality of that quote

// So, I am the owner/maintainer of over 150 open source repos. The most
// recognizable one is spritesmith with over 200 stars.

// Today, we will walk through how I create, maintain, and release repos.

// ## NEXT SLIDE

// First, creating a repo.

// TODO: Definitely record this via tee
