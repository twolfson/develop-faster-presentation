// As the title suggests, today we are going to be talking about developing faster.

// I am not going to be talking about developer hacks (e.g. 1 letter aliases)

// I am going to be focusing on tools.

// I like to think of a famous quote: "A man is only as good as his tools."

// TODO: Make comment about gender equality of that quote
